        <h1>A Breathtaking Ride</h1>
        <p>When it comes to cycling around parts of Northern California, you cannot forget to mention the amazing ride that is 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Diablo title="Mt. Diablo Wiki" target="_blank">Mt. Diablo. </a>
            Starting from the popular South Gate route, this out and back bike ride totals around 22 miles. When it comes to cycling this kind of distance isn't anything 
            out of the ordinary. What makes this ride incredibly unique in my opinion, is that it&apos;s essentially <strong>11 miles of constant climbing</strong> until you reach the 
            turnaround point - the top of the mountain. During this 11 mile climb, you will ascend around 3,250 feet! That&apos;s a lot of climbing, but fear not, the views 
            are second to none, making this an incredibly rewarding ride! Plus on the bright side, the last 11 miles are all downhill - just be safe and <strong>watch out for cars!</strong>
